In 1.Database/Design you will get relational diagram of DB it specifies tables names, fields and relationship between them.

### [1.2 DDL](http://https://github.com/Brallandev/dyp_technical_test/blob/main/1.Database/SQL/DDL.sql "### 1.2 DDL")
Execute DDL.sql for construct, database with it's tables into your DB Server 

### [1.3 DML](http://https://github.com/Brallandev/dyp_technical_test/blob/main/1.Database/SQL/DML.sql "### 1.3 DML")
For development and testing purposes, initial data is required, so DML.sql populates tables with contextual data that satisfies the previous stages of this technical test.
